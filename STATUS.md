### Resolved (All CRITICALs Cleared)

| ID | Finding | Fix |
|----|---------|-----|
| SEC-CRIT-01 | Bearer token prefix not stripped in authMiddleware | `token.replace(/^Bearer\s+/i, '')` |
| SEC-CRIT-02 | Client-supplied rate at `/call/end` — billing bypass | Rate stored server-side in `calls.rate_per_minute` |
| SEC-CRIT-03 | HMAC comparison with `===` — timing attack | `crypto.timingSafeEqual` on webhook + cleanup |
| SEC-CRIT-04 | `GET /astrologer/all` — unauthenticated | Route deleted entirely |
| SEC-CRIT-05 | `/availability/toggle` no ownership check | `requireAdmin` middleware added |
| SEC-CRIT-06 | `/payment/success` credits client-supplied amount | Server-stored order amount (orders table) |
| SEC-CRIT-07 | Webhook `atomicCredit` before order status claimed | Atomic `UPDATE WHERE status=created` |
| SEC-CRIT-08 | `authLimiter` on `/auth/logout` — NAT IP exhaustion DoS | Logout excluded from authLimiter |
| SEC-CRIT-09 | `settings.json` hardcoded Razorpay credentials | Env vars only; `bypassPermissions` removed |

### Verified by E2E (security_edge.spec.js)

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| User A cannot read User B wallet/history | ✅ Pass |
| Seeker B cannot end/rate Seeker A's call | ✅ Pass |
| Astrologer JWT blocked from seeker wallet | ✅ Pass (404) |
| SQL injection in name search + ID param | ✅ Pass (no crash, no data leak) |
| Double end-call idempotent — no double deduction | ✅ Pass |
| Duplicate rating returns 409 | ✅ Pass |

### Open

| ID | Finding | Priority |
|----|---------|----------|
| S10-SEC-04 | Verify test-mode HMAC guard doesn't silently pass in staging | 🟡 Medium |
| — | No `photo_url` upload endpoint — S3 presigned URL not yet implemented | 🟡 Low |
| — | Idempotency store is in-memory Map — won't survive restart | 🟡 Low (backed by DB for payments) |

### API Surface (13 route files, 30+ endpoints)

| Module | Endpoints | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Seeker Auth | register, login, refresh, logout | ✅ Complete |
| Astrologer Auth | register, login | ✅ Complete |
| Astrologer Public | list (with ratings), profile | ✅ Complete |
| Astrologer Private | me, availability, earnings, withdrawal | ✅ Complete |
| Call | start, end, decline, incoming, cleanup | ✅ Complete |
| Call History | paginated list | ✅ Complete |
| Wallet | balance, transactions, test-credit | ✅ Complete |
| Payments | create-order, success | ✅ Complete |
| Webhook | Razorpay payment.captured (atomic) | ✅ Complete |
| Admin | stats, astrologers, availability toggle, seed | ✅ Complete |
| Metrics/Health | /health (public), /metrics (admin) | ✅ Complete |

### Service Layer

| Service | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `walletEngine.atomicDeduct` | ✅ | `SELECT FOR UPDATE` + DB transaction; wallet_balance CHECK constraint |
| `walletEngine.atomicCredit` | ✅ | Idempotent via unique reference; 409 on duplicate |
| `callLifecycle.startCall` | ✅ | Marks astrologer unavailable atomically |
| `callLifecycle.finaliseCall` | ✅ | Uses `end_call` RPC — single atomic transaction for deduct+update+credit |
| `walletService.calculateDeduction` | ✅ | Single billing formula used everywhere |

### Observability

- **Structured logging:** `pino` + `pino-http` — JSON in production, pretty-print in dev
- **Health endpoint:** `GET /health` — DB connectivity check, uptime, unauthenticated
- **Error handling:** `unhandledRejection` → pino.fatal + process.exit(1)
- **Startup validation:** Fails fast if `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET` missing

### Open

| Item | Priority |
|------|----------|
| Pagination on `GET /astrologer` (deferred until >100 astrologers) | ⬜ P3 |
| `photo_url` upload endpoint (S3 presigned) | ⬜ P2 |
| Admin approval UI for withdrawal requests | ⬜ P2 |
| Full JWT revocation (currently: refresh token rotation only) | ⬜ P3 |

### Schema (16 migrations applied)

| Table | Purpose | Key Constraints |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `users` | Seekers | `wallet_balance CHECK >= 0`, `is_admin bool` |
| `astrologers` | Providers | `email UNIQUE`, `password_hash`, `earnings_balance`, `specialty/bio/photo_url` |
| `calls` | Call ledger | `status CHECK`, UNIQUE partial index (one active per user), `rating CHECK 1-5`, `rated_at` |
| `transactions` | Wallet ledger | `reference UNIQUE`, `type CHECK (credit/debit)`, `status CHECK (success/pending/failed)` |
| `orders` | Payment orders | `status CHECK (created/captured/failed)`, amount immutable after creation |
| `withdrawal_requests` | Payout requests | `status CHECK`, FK to astrologers |
| `refresh_tokens` | Auth tokens | `token_hash UNIQUE`, `revoked bool`, `expires_at` + idx |

### Views

| View | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `astrologer_avg_ratings` | `AVG(rating)` + `COUNT(*)` per astrologer — used by list + profile endpoints |

### RPCs

| RPC | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `end_call(call_id, user_id, rate_per_minute)` | Atomic: deduct seeker wallet + update call status + credit astrologer earnings |

### Indexes

| Index | Table | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `idx_calls_user_active` | calls | Partial: one active call per user |
| `idx_calls_astrologer` | calls | Astrologer incoming call lookup |
| `idx_rt_expires_at` | refresh_tokens | Cleanup query performance |
| `idx_calls_rated` | calls | Unique partial: one rating per call |

### Open

| Item | Priority |
|------|----------|
| RLS policies — currently rely on app-level auth; Supabase RLS not fully enforced for all tables | 🟡 Medium |
| `withdrawal_requests` admin approval workflow (status: pending → approved → paid) | ⬜ P2 |
| `photo_url` storage migration (Supabase Storage bucket) | ⬜ P2 |

| Per-minute billing with wallet | P0 | ✅ Done | — |
| Astrologer can accept / decline calls | P0 | ✅ Done | — |
| Astrologer can go online / offline | P0 | ✅ Done | — |
| Seeker can top up wallet (Razorpay) | P0 | ✅ Done | — |
| Post-call rating by seeker | P1 | ✅ Done | — |

| Push notifications for missed calls (FCM) | P1 | ⬜ Not started | Requires Firebase project |
| Astrologer KYC / onboarding | P2 | ⬜ Not started | — |
| Photo upload | P2 | ⬜ Deferred | Needs S3/Supabase Storage |
| Refund / dispute handling | P2 | ⬜ Not started | — |
| Pagination on astrologer list | P3 | ⬜ Deferred | Until >100 astrologers |

### User Journeys — End-to-End Verified

| Journey | Verified By |
|---------|------------|
| Seeker registers → tops up wallet → calls astrologer → rates call | UI-19 + UI-21 |
| Seeker views astrologer profile before calling | UI-17 |
| Seeker views wallet transaction history | UI-16 |
| Seeker views call history | UI-22 |
| Astrologer registers → goes online → receives incoming call → accepts | UI-25 |
| Astrologer declines call | UI-26 |
| Astrologer checks earnings after call | UI-24 |
| Astrologer requests withdrawal | EDGE-09 |

### Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Agora token expires mid-call (1hr) | Low | High | 55-min auto-end on client |
| Wallet deduction race (two simultaneous ends) | Very Low | Critical | `SELECT FOR UPDATE` + DB transaction |
| FCM not implemented — astrologer misses call when backgrounded | Medium | High | Polling fallback works when app foreground |
| No hosted deployment yet | — | Critical for launch | Docker + compose ready; needs cloud target |

## Summary — What's Done, What's Left

### Done ✅
- Full dual-role auth (seeker + astrologer) with JWT + refresh tokens
- Live voice calls with Agora RTC + per-minute billing
- Ratings, reviews, astrologer profiles
- Wallet top-up (Razorpay), transaction history, withdrawal requests
- 101 E2E tests (API, security, Flutter UI) — all passing with screenshots
- Production-grade logging (pino), env validation, CI/CD pipelines
- Docker setup with 4-service compose

### Remaining for Launch 🚀
1. **Deploy** — pick a host (Fly.io / Railway / Render), configure secrets, point DNS
2. **FCM push** — Firebase project setup, device token storage, send on missed call
3. **Flutter unit tests** — `test/wallet_provider_test.dart`, `test/auth_service_test.dart`
4. **Withdrawal admin approval** — admin screen to approve/reject withdrawal requests
5. **Docker build test** — run `docker compose up` end-to-end locally once Docker Desktop is available
