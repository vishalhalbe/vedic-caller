## Open Tasks

### TASK-06 · Validate and fix Flutter integration tests
**Issue:** #20  
**Files:** `apps/mobile/integration_test/`  
**Status:** 🟠 Pending — needs Flutter SDK + device locally

**Steps:**
- [ ] 6.1 Run `flutter pub get` in `apps/mobile/` — confirm no dependency errors
- [ ] 6.2 Run `flutter analyze` — fix any Dart analysis errors
- [ ] 6.3 Run `flutter test integration_test/` on a connected emulator or `--platform chrome`
- [ ] 6.4 Fix any test failures (likely: API base URL, mock setup)
- [ ] 6.5 Add `apps/mobile/test/` unit tests:
  - `test/wallet_provider_test.dart` — WalletNotifier initial fetch, refresh, error state
  - `test/auth_service_test.dart` — login success / 401 response handling
- [ ] 6.6 Confirm `flutter test test/` passes with mocked HTTP

**Acceptance criteria:** `flutter test` and `flutter test integration_test/` both exit 0 on a device/emulator. At least 2 unit tests exist under `test/`.

---

### TASK-10 · Rate limiting hardening
**Status:** ✅ Done — auth endpoints limited to 10 req/15min per IP, 429 test added

---

### TASK-11 · Refresh token pattern (full JWT revocation)
**Issue:** #18 follow-up  
**Files:** `backend/api/routes/auth.js`, new migration  
**Status:** ✅ Done

- [x] 11.1 Add `refresh_tokens` table (`supabase/migrations/20260416_refresh_tokens.sql`)
- [x] 11.2 `POST /auth/login` — access token (15min) + refresh token (30d, stored as SHA-256 hash)
- [x] 11.3 `POST /auth/refresh` — validates refresh token, issues new access + refresh (rotation)
- [x] 11.4 `POST /auth/logout` — marks refresh token as revoked
- [x] 11.5 Flutter: `TokenStorage` stores both tokens; `ApiClient` auto-refreshes on 401
- [x] 11.6 Tests: 6 new tests in `auth.test.js` covering refresh, reuse prevention, logout revocation

---

### TASK-13 · Remove hardcoded credential from .mcp.json
**Files:** `.mcp.json`  
**Status:** ✅ Done (simplified — no ToolHive dependency)  
**Why:** Live Razorpay credentials were hardcoded in `.mcp.json` args (Base64-encoded).

- [x] 13.1 Replaced hardcoded token with `${RAZORPAY_MCP_TOKEN}` env var reference in `.mcp.json`
- [x] 13.2 Added `RAZORPAY_MCP_TOKEN` to `.env.example` with instructions
- Note: Full ToolHive integration deferred — env var substitution is sufficient for now

## Session 8 Audit Findings

### 🟠 High

| ID | Finding | File | Status |
|----|---------|------|--------|
| S8-HIGH-01 | Cleanup endpoint restores astrologer availability without checking for other active calls | `routes/call.js:120` | ✅ Fixed — check remaining active calls before marking available |
| S8-HIGH-02 | No `process.on('unhandledRejection')` handler — async errors crash silently | `app.js` | ✅ Fixed — logs + exits on unhandled rejection |

### 🟡 Medium

| ID | Finding | File | Status |
|----|---------|------|--------|
| S8-MED-01 | Cleanup race: SELECT stale → UPDATE cancelled → set available is not atomic | `routes/call.js` | ⬜ Low priority — cleanup runs every 5min, window is tiny |
| S8-MED-02 | Idempotency middleware caches error responses (500) — retry with same key gets cached error | `middleware/idempotencyMiddleware_v2.js` | ⬜ Low impact — payment idempotency backed by DB; middleware is best-effort |
| S8-MED-03 | Admin toggle endpoint missing try-catch in Flutter UI | `admin_screen.dart` | ⬜ Deferred |

### ⬜ Low

| ID | Finding | File | Status |
|----|---------|------|--------|
| S8-LOW-01 | `GET /astrologer` has no pagination — will slow as catalog grows | `routes/astrologer.js` | ⬜ Deferred until > 100 astrologers |
| S8-LOW-02 | Agora 55-min limit hardcoded in client — server token TTL not returned | `routes/call.js`, `call_screen_v2.dart` | ⬜ Documented limitation |
| S8-LOW-03 | Double email lowercasing (client + server) — harmless but redundant | `auth_service.dart` | ⬜ Deferred |
